# Information Visualization project

## Checkpoint 4
Show your first functional prototype. In this version you must consider:
-    The layout of your visualization.
-    The implementation of (at least) two idioms.
-    That the different idioms must present some interactivity at an individual level.
-    The several idioms must “play well together”, being linked, using brushing, etc. (whatever is relevant). Rule of Thumb: this is one visualization not two or three separate ones on the same screen.
-    The consistency between different idioms (text size and font, colour, etc.).

**ULTIMATE GOAL**: at the end of this Checkpoint, you have a functional version of your visualization
mainly consisting of the creation of the layout and the implementation of at least two of the idioms
you have selected on Checkpoint III.
